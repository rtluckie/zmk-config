# This file specifies the build dependencies for Github Action workflows and
# for local build environments. The workspace has four toplevel directories
# containing the user config, modules, zephy and ZMK.
#
# ZMK-Workspace
# ├── config
# ├── modules
# ├── zephyr
# └── zmk
#
# To create a local build environment, clone this repository and then run the
# following commands from its toplevel directory:
#
# $ west init -l config
# $ west update
# $ west zephyr-export
